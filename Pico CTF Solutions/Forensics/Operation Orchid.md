# Disk Analysis - Medium Difficulty
- Download disk image and extract using `gunzip <filename>`.
- Now, start autopsy tool on linux by using `sudo autopsy`.
- Now, add image to a new case and search for txt files in all partitions.
- 2 results are returned, with 1 showing us that the file is encrypted and salted.
- Paste the contents of the file into a text file outside the disk image.
- We cannot break the encryption without a key.
- So, we need to look through all strings in the disk
  - Use `strings <disk_image> | grep '<keyword>'`.
  - Now, replace keyword with strings like 'pico', 'flag', etc.
- We get hits when we search for strings containing 'flag'.
- One of the results include - `openssl aes256 -salt -in flag.txt -out flag.txt.enc -k unbreakablepassword1234567`.
  - This suggets that the flag in the encrypted file is aes256 encrypted with the password 'unbreakablepassword1234567'.
- Now, the output that we just analyzed is a command in itself.
  - Edit the command and include appropriate file names.
  - Also include `-d` in the command to indicate decryption.
- The file gets decrypted and we can open the output file to obtain the flag.
